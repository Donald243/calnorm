### Calculator App Using Tkinter

This Python project is a **simple GUI-based calculator** created using the `tkinter` library. It provides basic arithmetic and mathematical operations in a user-friendly layout. The program demonstrates the use of Python's GUI capabilities and integrates mathematical expressions for evaluation.

#### Features:
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
2. **Scientific Functions**: Includes trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithmic functions (`log`, `log10`), permutations (`perm`), combinations (`comb`), and constants like `pi`.
3. **Dynamic Button Input**: Supports number and operator inputs dynamically.
4. **Undo Functionality**: Allows users to remove the last entered character.
5. **Clear All (AC)**: Resets the input field.
6. **Real-Time Evaluation**: Computes results for complex mathematical expressions securely.

#### Technical Details:
- **Frontend**: Built with `tkinter` to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python's `ast` module to parse and evaluate expressions securely. The `math` module provides support for advanced mathematical operations.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures user input is parsed and evaluated safely to prevent errors or crashes.

#### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script in a Python environment with `tkinter` support.
3. Use the number buttons, operators, and functions to perform calculations.
4. Click `=` to evaluate the expression, `AC` to clear the input field, or `<-` to undo the last character.

#### Example:
You can calculate expressions like:
- `3 + 5 * 2`
- `sin(pi/2) + log10(100)`
- `(5 + 3) * **2`

This project is a great starting point for those learning GUI development in Python and provides a template for expanding functionality into more advanced calculators or applications.
